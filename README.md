# Regression model of a wastewater phytoremediation process

This project was a collaboration for the Faculty of Environmental Engineering. After a phytoremediation process implemented in the wastewater of a rural area near the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, it was necessary to project the variables taken from the water to determine future action plans on the process. Therefore, numerical methods were implemented in the R language, and with polynomial linear regressions to determine the equations necessary for a projection of the variables.
